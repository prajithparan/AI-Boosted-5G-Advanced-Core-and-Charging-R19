## ADR-0008: CI split into build / sanitize / lint jobs on free GitHub-hosted runners

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** User chose free-tier CI compute (no self-hosted runners) and small-increment cadence.

**Decision:** Three jobs: `build` (plain Debug build + ctest), `sanitize` (matrix: ASan+UBSan vs.
TSan, kept as two separate configs since they're mutually exclusive at compile time), `lint`
(clang-format --dry-run, clang-tidy). vcpkg binary caching via `actions/cache` to keep runtimes
reasonable on the free tier.

**Rejected alternative:** A libFuzzer job. Deferred -- there's no codec worth fuzzing yet; the
first real target is the PFCP codec in Phase 3.
