## ADR-0007: ProblemDetails/InvalidParam hand-written in sbi-core, not generated

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted (disclosed, deliberate exception to "never hand-write a DTO")

**Context:** `sbi-core` (Phase 0) is itself a dependency of `tools/sbi-codegen` (Phase 1) -- there
is no codegen pipeline yet to generate anything from. But `ProblemDetails` (TS 29.500 clause 5.2.7
generic error handling) is needed by sbi-core's own server/client error paths.

**Decision:** `sbi_core::ProblemDetails` and `sbi_core::InvalidParam` are hand-written in
`libs/sbi-core/include/sbi_core/problem_details.hpp`, with every field name transcribed verbatim
from `specs/5G_APIs-REL-19/TS29571_CommonData.yaml` (commit `bca84b6`, lines 518-559 and 615-630).
Three fields that reference other files' schemas (`accessTokenError`, `accessTokenRequest`,
`noProfileMatchInfo`) are carried as opaque `nlohmann::json` rather than fully modeled, since fully
modeling them would mean also generating the NRF access-token/discovery schemas early.

**Consequence:** Once Phase 1's codegen exists, generated NF code should depend on and reuse
`sbi_core::ProblemDetails` rather than regenerating a second copy from `CommonData.yaml` --
otherwise there would be two competing definitions of the same wire type.
