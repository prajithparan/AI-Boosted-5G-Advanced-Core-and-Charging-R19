## ADR-0004: Hand-rolled HTTP/2 server on raw nghttp2 + Boost.Asio

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The mandated stack lists "nghttp2 (core), Boost.Beast or Pistache for the service
layer." In practice: vcpkg's `nghttp2` port builds only the core C library, not upstream's bundled
`asio_http2` ("nghttp2-asio") convenience wrapper -- it isn't packaged at all. Neither Boost.Beast
(HTTP/1.1 + WebSocket only) nor Pistache (HTTP/1.1 only) implement HTTP/2. Since the non-negotiable
rules require "100% of SBI traffic is HTTP/2," something has to actually speak the protocol.

**Decision:** `libs/sbi-core`'s `http2::Server` drives nghttp2's raw C session API
(`nghttp2_session_server_new`, `nghttp2_session_mem_recv`/`mem_send`, header/frame/data callbacks)
directly, with Boost.Asio supplying the TCP accept/read/write loop. See
`libs/sbi-core/src/http2_server.cpp`.

**Rejected alternative:** Add Drogon (MIT, in vcpkg, has built-in HTTP/2 support) as the server
framework. Would have cut implementation effort significantly, but deviates from the brief's
mandated stack without being asked for; user chose the raw-nghttp2 path specifically to avoid an
undisclosed dependency substitution.

**Consequence:** More code to review and maintain than a framework would need, and it's the
highest-risk hand-written piece in Phase 0 -- stream lifecycle and flow-control bugs here would be
subtle. Flagged explicitly for extra scrutiny during build/test (see PHASE0-NOTES below).
